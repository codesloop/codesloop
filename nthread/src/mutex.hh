       @li the ability to query the number of waiting threads
       @li the ability to recursively lock and unlock the mutex
       @li if a thread locks the mutex than it unlocks that when the thread exits
       @li the ability to tell wether the mutex is locked without actually locking it

       the design decision here is not to expose any pthread details, so
       the underlying implementation may change if needed. this is also true
       for the underlying pthread concepts. this is intended to be a higher
       level abstraction, than what pthread provides.
