nthread module
=============

Cross platform threading implementation. This implementation has a high level interface to threading primitives. The goals of this module is to provide useful abstractions and help preventing common programming errors while providing a common interface on Posix and Win32. Examples of these paradigms:

* Automatic unlock of a locked mutex on thread exit. (A common source of threading errors.)
* Ability to check the number of waiting threads for a mutex of event.
* Post and store notifications for events before others started waiting for them.
* etc.

Check sources and tests for more information.
