       @brief Helper to generate challenge and the corresponding response

       The role of ecdh_pkt is to generate a challenge and process the response
       and generate the shared secret: the session key. The party that generates
       the challenge is refered as server and the other side is client. This
       is just terminology. In real life different scenarios can be imagined.

       ecdh_pkt has no transport logic built in. It works on buffers and it is
       not its responsibility to transfer these.

       ecdh_pkt is not able to encrypt external buffers or streams. However it
       does encrypt the credential information (login and password) using the
       generated session key and crypt_buf.

       The generated packets are encoded using XDR under the cover.

       The implementation details of OpenSSL, ECDH cryptography and XDR are
       not exposed to the public interface. This is a design decision to make
       the interface stable and the implementation could be changed without
       changing its users.

       The only OpenSSL exposed part is the name of the algorithms that may
       be used for generating the session key.

       The challenge packet has the following contents:

       @li A set of EC challenge keys (1-3 items, depending on the settings)
       @li An optional server certificate (compressed by zfile)

       The response packet has the following contents:

       @li A response EC key
       @li Client certificate (compressed by zfile)
       @li Client credentials (login and password : encrypted w/ session key)

       The challenge packet contains maximum 3 ECDH keys from which the client
       chooses which one to use. This value is chosen to provide some degree
       of flexiblity but still make the key generation fast. If too many keys
       would be generated and sent, it would seriously hurt performance.

       The client and server certificates are handled as uninterpreted binary
       data. This data is placed into the buffer in compressed form and will
       be decompressed automatically. The reason for this is to save space, so
       a challenge with a reasonable sized certificate can fit into an UDP
       packet. The maximum compressed certificate size is CSL_CERTIFICATE_MAX_LEN
       that is 4096 bytes at the current implementation.
