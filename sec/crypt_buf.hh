       @brief Helper for en/decryption

       crypt_buf en/decrypts data in place, so no output buffer is used.

       The encryption is done in three steps:

       @li Initialization
       @li En/Decryption
       @li Checksum/MAC calculation

       The initialization part does two things, initialize the internal variables
       and generates a random number to be fed to the encryption. This random
       number is used to ensure that different runs generate different results and
       also used by the Checksum calculation.

       En/Decryption has a streaming like interface, where each call to add_data()
       adds new plain/encrypted parts to the stream.
       The data buffer don't have to be aligned or padded.

       When all data was en/decrypted then the finalize() function generates the
       Checksum/MAC. This can be used to check message integrity.

       The crypt_buf class uses the blowfish encryption provided by the OpenSSL
       library. The MAC generation is done by creating SHA1 sum of the initial
       random number, that will be fed to the encryption at the end. Since
       every byte effects the next bytes in the stream then this would be sufficient
       to ensure message integrity.

       The interface is designed to hide the internal details of OpenSSL and
       the encryption function used, so if they need to be changed, than only
       the implementation would change not the interface.
