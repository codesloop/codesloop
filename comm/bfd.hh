    /**
    This is a generic class that buffers read, recv and recvfrom operations on a given fd.

    It tries to read as many bytes possible to fill the internal buffer. The read-like operations
    may or may not read from the fd depending on the given function. For some it is feasible to return
    a buffer without touching the network.

    The rationale behind this is, it tries to decouple the network operations from the data needs of the
    application. For some scenarios the read multiplexing may execute unneccessary loops when not all data
    have been read from the socket. This class helps as long as it has enough space in the buffer.

    In other scenarios the data may arrive in smaller portions than it makes sense for the application.
    Buffering helps to merge small pieces together. However the application must keep in mind that it only
    have a limited buffer space, so care must be taken.

    The write-like operations are not buffered at all.

    The internal buffer space is initially 1k, this may grow dynamically up to 256k.

        this function first checks wether there is data in the buffer. if so it returns that
        without trying to read from the network even if its size is smaller than the required amount.
        if no data is in the buffer then it tries to read big to fill the buffer.

        to enforce reading from the network use the read_some() family, and check the size() in the buffer.
