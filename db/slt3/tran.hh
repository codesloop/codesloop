      the pupose of this class is to enforce transaction usage and also help managing them.
      it supports nested transactions that are implemented as SQLite3 savepoints.

      transaction objects may automatically commit or rollback transactions at destruction.
      the default is to commit started transaction on destruction. This may be changed.

      tran object is used with synqry objects to start user specified queries.

      tran object copies the use_exc value of the parent object at construction time
      use_exc tells wether to throw slt3::exc exceptions on errors. if they are not used
      then the return value of the given function tells that it is failed. the error message
      is sent to stderr.
