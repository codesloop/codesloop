    /**
    @brief circular buffer

    the purpose of this class is to help implementing message buffers in a multithreaded
    environment. the memory management of the allocated items is handled by this class.

    users of circbuf may push or pop items into and from the circular buffer. the push operation
    may be split into prepare and {commit,rollback} steps. because of the item data is managed
    by circbuf (rather then the users) the multithreaded push may need to lock the item and the queue
    to work properly. here is when the two-phase push come into the picture. the two phases only
    need to lock the item and the queu for a short period of time.

    locking and other threading primitives are not built into circbuf. users are expected to subclass
    circbuf and implement the needed features there. virtual functions are defined to help this.

    the circbuf class uses a double-linked list to store items. it has three lists. one contains the
    active items. an other contains the free items to be reused. the third list contains the items that
    are about to be pushed (under preparation).
